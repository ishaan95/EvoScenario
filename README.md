# EvoScenario
Evolutionary scenarios for training reinforcement learning driving agents and testing any vehicle in the CARLA simulator. 

## Proposed goals of this project
* Procedural generation of progressively difficult driving scenarios. A final outcome would be to procedurally (algorithmically) generate a catalog of CARLA world scenarios. The difficulty of scenarios should be traced in the form of a tree. 

* Robust autonomous vehicle driving agent.

## Breakdown of goals
* Generate progressively difficult roads procedurally.
* Generate progressively difficult NPCs procedurally.
* Plug-in autonomous vehicle and expose vulnerabilities in the form of a visualization.
* Create a CARLA based tool for autonomous vehicle developers to easily test their work.
