# EvoScenario
Evolutionary scenarios for training reinforcement learning driving agents and testing any vehicle in the CARLA simulator.

***

## Proposed goals of this project
* Procedural generation of progressively difficult driving scenarios. A final outcome would be to procedurally (algorithmically) generate a catalog of CARLA world scenarios. The difficulty of scenarios should be traced in the form of a tree. 

* Robust autonomous vehicle driving agent.

### Breakdown of goals (all work built on top of CARLA)
* Procedural road generator
  * Road intersections
* Procedural NPC generator
  * Vehicle behavior
  * Pedestrian behavior
  * Cyclist behavior
* (Stretch goal; may not achieve) Procedural cities/towns/villages 
* Plug-in autonomous vehicle and expose vulnerabilities in the form of a visualization.
* Create a CARLA based tool for autonomous vehicle developers to easily test their work.
